Relief mapping test
===================

Implementation of relief mapping technique in Python, OpenGL and GLSL.

Relief mapping is a method for applying a height map on a polygon so 
that the height map can self-occlude and self-shadow. This makes it more 
realistic (and more time-consuming) than bump mapping or parallax 
mapping.

Arrow keys, Page Up and Page Down control the viewpoint, mouse rotates 
the cube.

Also included: anaglyph mode! Grab your red-cyan glasses and press 'a'.

Required packages:
pygame
PyOpenGL
